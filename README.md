# algebra-solver
A python algebra equation solver using only included libraries. 
I made a new algorithm that's better. A problem with this algorithm is finding a solution to something sorta like 0=-.0000000001+(x-10)^2 where the parabola barely dips below the x axis. Also, it's much easier to implement complex and multiple solutions with my better min value algorithm. An example combined loading homework problem I did today that it could not solve was 51 [ksi] = sqrt(32.595^2 + (977x)^2) [ksi] So, I had to use my min value solver instead which is better but doesn't have a nice gui yet.
