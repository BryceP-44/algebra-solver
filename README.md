# algebra-solver
A python algebra equation solver using only included libraries. 
I made a new algorithm that's better. A problem with this algorithm is finding a solution to something like 0=-.0000000001+(x-10)^2 where the parabola barely dips below the x axis. Also, it's much easier to implement complex and multiple solutions with my better min value algorithm.
